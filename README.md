the DETR model for object detection in images. DETR from Hugging Face is a remarkably powerful model capable of identifying and annotating objects in an image with high accuracy.

✔ Project Objectives:
Upload an image from the local system.
Run the DETR model on the image to detect objects.
Annotate and display the detected objects in the image.

✔Achieved Results:
I could successfully detect several objects in different images and annotate these objects with bounding boxes and classification labels.

✔Technologies Used:
Hugging Face Transformers for the DETR model.
Programming Language: Python
PyTorch for GPU calculations.
PIL and OpenCV for image processing and display.
Google Colab for code execution.

✔ Project Details:
Initialization: Load the image and convert to the compatible format.
Preprocessing: Prepare data for the model.
Object Detection: Run the DETR model for detecting objects.
Annotation: Draw bounding boxes and add class labels.
I am really excited about how AI and object detection models can be used to improve a wide range of applications, from surveillance to image classification tasks in medical domains.
